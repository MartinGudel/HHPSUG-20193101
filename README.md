This talk is focussed on using OAuth2 Authentication Workflows to get access to Webservice APIs, line Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and the Microsoft Cloud Platform on Microsoft Azure / Office 365.

You also will find my example code, which is basically based on the links included in the PowerShell files.
